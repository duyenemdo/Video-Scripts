## News Update July 31st, 2020 - Transcript including links to sources

Hello everyone, welcome to a new Decred Bi-weekly News Update. Lately, there has been a ton of discussion around Marketing and how we can bring Decred to the masses, and get this project the recognition it deserves. Discussions are taking place on the decred Subreddit, discord and on chat.decred.org

This effort is being spearheaded by popular on-chain research analyst Checkmate who has been regularly driving discussion weekly on Reddit on how we can improve the Decred protocol, and discuss any skepticisms the community may have.

The general consensus is that the project does indeed need marketing in order to spread awareness and grow, but it needs to be done in a fashion that puts results first while remaining low in cost. Past efforts were the opposite, they weren’t driven by metrics and were expensive, leaving a bad taste in Stakeholders mouths towards any marketing campaigns.

With so many different crypto projects out there, many of which spending large sums of money on marketing, how do we make Decred stand out and kickstart a network effect that will raise the value of the currency, while doing so in a creative way that makes the project go viral.

Sound, legitimate efforts and ideas are welcome. TIme wasting Shower thoughts are not welcome...however we created a new chatroom for them if you’d like to share yours.

Anyways, lets get into this week’s updates:

Inside Crypto Today wrote up an article on Politeia explaining how the platform facilitates Decred’s governance and the lifecycle of proposals. It’s great to see more eyes on Politeia, with the author clearly understanding its importance for the Decred DAO.

Schnorr signatures will be used on TSpend transactions, Decred Dev Marco Peereboom reports. The @decredproject decentralized treasury spends just became a bit shinier.

There has been discussion on twitter over whether Decred is Decentralized Finance.

While some want to avoid the term, others want to embrace it as it is gaining popularity.


Klara Kerr says Decred could market itself as the true DeFi platform, and FLash says decred is the only defi project that is decentralized and secure.

ChappJC says I dunno what counts as DeFi, but the initial release of DCRDEX for mainnet is very close. Non-rent-seeking, open source DEX software that anyone can operate, with no utility tokens or needless complexity since there are no trade fees! Brought to you by Decred. Stay tuned.

The DEX is going to be one of many examples of rigged systems unrigged via the Decred DAO and the stakeholder collective.

Leave a comment in the video description if you think Decred should embrace the Defi Hashtag, or stay away from it to avoid being lumped in with unfavorable projects.

Dcrd version 1.6.0 is 95% complete as per github. This release is absolutely huge for the project as it will add privacy and decentralized treasury spending among other important updates. I believe marketing efforts will be much more fruitful once we have these core features in place, as they really

DCR Australia has coined the term “DCR DIET, whereby people choose to spend their money on buying decred over fast food, or unnecessary items. I think everyone should go on the DCR diet. I actually do wish I had bought more DCR instead of buying that drink.

I really think we can help bring decred to the masses by ramping up our memeage so guys don’t hold back, lets see some memes.

Decred Developer Jamie Holdstock reports that vspd is nearing completion and that they are looking for VSP operators to help test it on Mainnet.

Vspd brings a few different new benefits such as Increased user privacy like no address reuse, and the option to use CoinShuffle++, Decred’s privacy implementation when Staking.
There’s also No more account registration.

The latest Decred in Depth Podcast roundup has been released:

Richard Red Created a fun clay animation video featuring a ticket that is called to vote immediately after entering the ticket pool. Remember, tickets are chosen pseudorandomly once entering the ticketpool, though it usually takes around 1 month. Check out my How To Stake video on this channel to see just how easy it is to buy tickets of your own. Maybe yours will be called to vote in the next block, but no promises.

https://proposals.decred.org/

On Politeia we have 3 new proposals being discussed and one proposal that has finished voting.

The Augmented Reality Posters proposal from Mission and Sylvia is currently up for discussion.

The goal is to create 10 Augmented Reality Posters for Decred that would be used as marketing materials for both the internet and in-person events.

These posters do not require special Virtual Reality glasses to view. You only need to use your mobile device, and for certain posters, a free mobile app.

Here’s an example of what the virtual reality looks like viewed through a phone:

Mission says they are ready to start the work on the posters immediately and that one poster per month would be delivered at a cost of $1,500 for 10 successive months, making the total ask $15,000 dollars payable in Decred for 10 Augmented Reality Posters.

Thus far comments have been critical about the purpose and effectiveness of having Virtual Reality Posters, also questioning the “Why” portion of the proposal which says the proposal authors would like to expand their portfolio, which isn’t seen as suitable for Politeia. Commenters have also requested that Decred specific posters be generated so the community would have a better idea of what to expect.

Bee has published the Moderation of Decred Communications Proposal.
The goal of this proposal is to establish a budget for the moderation and management of Decred’s primary communication platforms on Matrix, Politeia, Discord, and Telegram over a period of 6 months.

This is work that has been on-going, but it has now been brought to Politeia to be approved by Stakeholders, as with the upcoming decentralized treasury, all projected expenditures must be billed against an approved proposal, making expenditures completely transparent to stakeholders.

The proposal asks for a capped limit of $1,500 a month, with expected costs of $800 per month. This translates to a maximum of $9,000 per month, with an expected amount of $4,800.

Moderation of Reddit was initially included in the proposal, but it was removed due to Reddit’s policy that forbids paying Moderators.

The highest ranked comment is happy these types of things are moving to Politeia to get stakeholder approval however, he doesn’t believe Decred needs paid mods, citing the Bitcoin and Monero communities which are run by un-paid volunteers. The general idea here is that by paying people, you scare off potential volunteers that would work for free, and that it hampers organic community growth.

Others voiced similar thoughts, though there was praise towards the budget and layout of the proposal.

A new proposal from Travala has been published. Travala is a platform for flight, hotel and accommodation booking focusing on cryptocurrency technology and the community built around it. Think of it as the cryptocurrency version of Expedia, which is partnered with Travala.

For a cost of $51,500 USD payable in Decred, Travala will integrate Decred on their platform and on travelbybit, which is powered by Binance.  They will also run an advertising campaign to help boost the brand. Advertising includes videos, banners, stories, press releases, blogs, and explainers, among other promotions.

Travala claims advertising and adding DCR as a payment method for their services will bring about more exposure, help reach bigger audiences, and create a massive use case for Decred on millions of available products through their platform.

Comments are still on-going.

Monde PR’s Proposal to continue Public Relations and Media efforts has passed with 90% yes votes and a voter turnout of 25% with over 10,000 votese cast.

A proposal must have 60% yes votes in order to pass with at least a 20% voter quorum. 

You can join in on the discussion by going to proposals.decred.org and making an account.

Stakeholders vote on proposal via Decred’s GUI wallet Decredition in the Governance tab, or via command line.

Thanks for tuning into this week's episode, be sure to follow decred on twitter and don’t be scared to join in on the discussions happening on Reddit, Discord, and Matrix.
